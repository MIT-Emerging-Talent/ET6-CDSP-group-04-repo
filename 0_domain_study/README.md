# 💼 Domain Study: Career Pathways into IT for Displaced Youth (United States)

## 1. Introduction

Millions of displaced youth in the U.S. face significant barriers in accessing sustainable employment.  
The tech sector offers a promising path due to its demand for talent, flexibility, and growing emphasis  
on skills over degrees. However, individuals without prior exposure to tech — especially those navigating  
displacement, trauma, and socioeconomic challenges — often remain excluded from these opportunities.  
Our research focuses on understanding the accessibility and impact of various entry points into IT careers,  
especially non-traditional pathways such as bootcamps, online courses, and workforce development programs.

## 2. Why This Domain Matters

- 🚸 **Displaced youth face unique employment obstacles**: These include interrupted education,  
  legal/work permit complexities, trauma, and lack of localized social networks or mentorship in the tech industry.  
- 💡 **The tech industry is changing**: Increasingly, employers are open to hiring based on skills, not just degrees.  
  Programs like Google Career Certificates or Microsoft’s workforce initiatives are trying to bridge the gap.  
- 📊 **Opportunity for systems-level transformation**: If successful models are identified and scaled,  
  the tech sector could become a major vehicle for economic mobility for displaced populations.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

> Displaced youth in the U.S. who lack prior tech experience often face limited access to employer-relevant  
> IT career pathways. Traditional higher education may be inaccessible due to time, cost, language,  
> or eligibility barriers, while alternative models vary in quality, support, and employer recognition.  
> There is an urgent need to identify what pathways work best — and for whom.

## 👤 Personal Lens on the Problem: Khadija’s Experience in US

As someone who spent nearly 20 months living in the United States — particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area,  
the epicenter of the tech world — I saw firsthand both the incredible promise of the IT sector and the difficult  
barriers that prevent displaced individuals from accessing it.

The U.S. is home to countless job opportunities, especially in tech, but the reality for many asylum seekers is  
far from easy. While asylees are allowed to apply for work permits about six months after filing, access to  
higher education remains nearly impossible due to the overwhelming cost — a challenge that even American  
citizens struggle with. That means that for many newcomers, traditional college pathways into IT careers  
are simply not an option.

At the same time, alternative routes like online certificates, bootcamps, and workforce development programs  
are emerging — some even right in Silicon Valley. But as I observed, these programs vary widely in quality,  
credibility, and support. For a young, displaced individual with no tech background, navigating this confusing  
maze can be overwhelming. It’s hard to know which programs are trustworthy, which are recognized by employers,  
and which will actually lead to a job.

This research matters to me because I’ve seen how complex and discouraging the system can be — even in a place  
filled with opportunity. I want us to understand which pathways work best for people like our case study — a  
21-year-old displaced individual trying to start a tech career in the U.S. — and how we can make those pathways  
clearer, more inclusive, and more supportive.

## 🧠 Group Understanding of the Problem (Systems Thinking Preview)

In approaching this domain, we use a systems thinking lens to understand the interconnected challenges affecting  
displaced youth in tech. Our goal is not only to examine individual pathways but also to understand the broader  
ecosystem shaping access, training, and employment.

### 🌐 System Components We Are Exploring

- **Actors**: Displaced youth, training providers, employers, nonprofits, and policymakers  
- **Structures**: Immigration policies, credentialing systems, job market requirements  
- **Patterns**: Skill gaps, dropout rates, underemployment  
- **Mental Models**: Employer assumptions about degrees; societal views on refugees' abilities

We will explore these elements deeper in our next milestone — focusing on how they interact, where bottlenecks  
exist, and which levers of change can enable equitable access to tech careers for displaced individuals.
