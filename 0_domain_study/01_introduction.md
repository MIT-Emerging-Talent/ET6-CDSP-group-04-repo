# Title: Navigating Career Pathways into IT for Young Displaced Individuals without Prior Tech Backgrounds

## Understanding the Context - Education, Displacement and Tech Access in the U.S

Globally, there's an increasing number of people currently displaced due to conflict,
persecution, or economic instability and many of them are youth seeking
to rebuild their lives in unfamiliar territories. In the United States,
thousands of young displaced individuals arrive every year, hoping to
find safety, stability, and opportunity.

This project focuses on one specific group: young displaced individuals,
around the age of 21, who have completed secondary education but have no
prior experience in technology. They arrive in the U.S. with limited
financial resources, little to no social network, and face significant
cultural, linguistic, and systemic barriers as they attempt to build a future.

While technology is one of the most accessible and upwardly mobile sectors
in the U.S. job market, entry into the tech workforce often assumes access
to formal education, digital literacy, or insider knowledge, all of which
are difficult for displaced youth to obtain. Many are left wondering: I
s university the only path? Are bootcamps credible? Will employers take me seriously?

Education is more than just skills acquisition, it is a pathway
to integration, dignity, and long-term independence. For displaced
individuals, especially youth, access to affordable, effective, and
recognized learning models is a critical stepping stone to achieving
 stable employment and becoming full participants in their new society.

This context sets the foundation for our research into the most viable
educational and career pathways into IT for displaced youth in the U.S.
We explore how non-traditional models like coding bootcamps, online
micro-certifications, and apprenticeships compare to formal degrees in
terms of accessibility, outcomes, and employer perception.

By understanding the lived realities and structural barriers faced by
these individuals, we can better evaluate what learning models truly
work and ultimately help build a data-informed framework that guides
displaced youth into meaningful, sustainable tech careers.
