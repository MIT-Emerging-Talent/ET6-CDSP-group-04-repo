# Cleaned Data: Guide

This folder stores datasets that have been cleaned and are ready for exploration or analysis.

Cleaning may include:
- Renaming columns
- Removing duplicates or nulls
- Standardizing formats (e.g., dates, text)
- Filtering out irrelevant rows

Each `.csv` file here should:
- Have a corresponding cleaning notebook in `notebooks/cleaning/`
- Be described in `data_documentation.md`
