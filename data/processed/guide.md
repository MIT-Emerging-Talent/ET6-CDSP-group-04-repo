# Processed Data: Guide

This folder is optional and used for storing datasets that have been transformed specifically for modeling or experimentation.

Examples include:
- Train/validation/test splits
- Feature-engineered versions of cleaned data
- Scaled or normalized datasets

Only include files here if your project involves predictive modeling. Otherwise, leave this folder empty or remove it.
