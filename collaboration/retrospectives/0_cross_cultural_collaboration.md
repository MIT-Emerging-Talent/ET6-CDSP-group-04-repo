# Retrospectives Milestone 0

## Milestone 0 Retrospective: Cross-Cultural Collaboration

This document summarizes the retrospective of our project's initial milestone:  
establishing effective cross-cultural collaboration. It highlights key learnings,
challenges, and successes we've experienced in the early stages of our project.

* This retrospective reflects on our team’s journey during Milestone 0, which  
  focused on building effective cross-cultural collaboration and setting a  
  strong foundation for future milestones. Despite initial challenges, our team
  remained committed and proactive in learning from the process. Here's what we
  learned, what worked, what didn’t, and what we plan to improve moving forward.

### Stop Doing

* Going long periods without scheduled check-ins made it difficult to stay on  
  track.
* Delaying the assignment of clear roles (like lead or coordinator) negatively  
  impacted structure and task distribution.
* Not informing the team about extended inactivity caused disruptions in  
  collaboration.
* Overlooking the syllabus and milestone timelines led to missed deliverables.

### Continue Doing

* Maintaining a supportive and respectful team culture where everyone feels safe
  to ask questions and contribute ideas.
* Using Slack, WhatsApp, and GitHub Issues effectively for different types of  
  communication (asynchronous, quick coordination, and structured discussion).
* Being transparent about progress and setbacks, and stepping up to support each
  other when needed.
* Acknowledging members’ strengths (e.g., technical leadership) and encouraging
  initiative.

### Start Doing

* Holding regular weekly check-in calls (now scheduled for Mondays and Thursdays)
  to ensure alignment and real-time collaboration.
* Assigning responsibilities earlier in the process to avoid ambiguity and delays.
* Creating documentation for team roles, decisions, and tasks as early as  
  possible in the sprint.
* Actively reviewing the syllabus and project board to align on deadlines and  
  expectations.
* Inform the group in advance if you expect to be unavailable or less responsive,
  so the team can adjust plans accordingly.
* Adding brief summaries after each meeting to make sure we’re all on the same  
  page.

### Lessons Learned

* Cross-cultural, cross-timezone teams thrive with explicit structure and early
  planning.
* “No stupid questions” is a valuable norm, asking for help creates a stronger  
  and more resilient team.
* Milestone deadlines can be recovered from if team dynamics remain healthy and
  there’s mutual accountability.
* Positive dynamics matter just as much as productivity, mutual respect and open
  communication were key to maintaining morale during the initial challenges.
* A well-scoped and communicated plan is more valuable than trying to figure  
  things out as you go.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of our plan went as expected?

* We successfully established our group norms early on, as initially planned.
* Communication platforms (Slack, WhatsApp, GitHub Issues) were agreed upon and
  used consistently.
* Availability was shared, and initial meeting times were discussed as expected.

### What parts of our plan did not work out?

* We didn’t schedule recurring meetings early enough, which delayed coordination.
* Important documents like the syllabus and milestone deadlines were overlooked,
  causing us to miss the initial Milestone 0 deadline.
* Leadership and role assignment weren’t addressed in our first plan, which  
  affected structure and task ownership.
* Coordinating schedules across time zones was more difficult than expected.

### Did we need to add things that weren't in our strategy?

* Yes — we added:
  * Twice-weekly recurring meetings (Mondays and Thursdays) to improve  
    coordination.
  * Task assignment responsibilities to individuals to clarify ownership.
  * A culture of documenting all decisions and meeting notes in the repo to avoid
    miscommunication.
  * Backup roles for key deliverables to ensure continuity (e.g., backup presenter
    for the course-wide meeting).

### Did we need to remove extra steps?

* There weren't any extra steps.
