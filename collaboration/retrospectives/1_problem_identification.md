# Retrospectives Milestone 1

## Milestone 1 Retrospective: Problem Identification

This document summarizes the retrospective for **Milestone 1: Problem
Identification**. It highlights the key learnings, challenges, and successes
our team experienced while defining a data science problem grounded in personal
experiences, conducting domain research, and formulating an actionable research
question.

Despite constraints and challenges, our team remained committed and
collaborative. This retrospective captures what worked, what didn’t, and what
we aim to improve moving forward.

---

## Stop Doing

- Delaying planning, task listing, and early task assignment.
- Being inactive for long periods without informing the team in advance, which
  can unintentionally disrupt collaboration.
- Waiting for everyone to be active before sending reminders or pinging team
  members as this delayed momentum.
- Delaying documentation of meeting notes and decisions, making it harder to
  track progress.
- Accumulating work until close to the deadline, which increases stress and
  reduces quality.

---

## Continue Doing

- Maintaining open, respectful discussions where everyone can suggest ideas
  based on personal experiences.
- Using Slack and GitHub effectively for async communication and documentation.
- Regularly reviewing the syllabus and project board to stay aligned on
  deliverables and deadlines.
- Sharing personal constraints and availability transparently to enable flexible
  collaboration.
- Hopping on meetings with available team members, then summarizing discussions
  for those who couldn’t attend to gather their input.
- Regularly checking the project GitHub to catch conflicts or technical issues
  early and address them before they escalate.

---

## Start Doing

- Breaking down complex problems into smaller, actionable components earlier.
- Assigning a note-taker for each meeting to track decisions and next steps.
- Creating early drafts of deliverables to allow time for iteration and feedback.
- Proactively checking in on teammate progress and blockers between meetings.
- Assigning tasks as early as possible to avoid falling behind on deadlines.

---

## Lessons Learned

- Defining a clear, feasible research question requires balancing ambition with
  data and time constraints — many ideas were interesting but hard to work on.
- Personal experience-driven problem selection deepens motivation and engagement.
- Starting structured work early helps avoid blockers and last-minute stress.
- Group work is most effective when there’s mutual respect, open-mindedness, and
  commitment from all members.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of our plan went as expected?

- We successfully generated a wide range of problem ideas rooted in team members'
  personal experiences.
- Communication platforms (Slack, GitHub Issues) continued to work well for
  updates and documentation.
- Our group norms and learning goals document was maintained and updated.
- We submitted our deliverables and created the Git tag on time.

### What parts did not work out?

- We underestimated how long it would take to converge on a single, feasible
  problem statement.
- We did not assign clear ownership of background research sections early, which
  delayed synthesis.
- Meeting scheduling across time zones remained difficult, occasionally
  affecting participation.

### Did we need to add things that weren't in our strategy?

- Yes — we added:
  - A decision matrix to help prioritize and evaluate problem ideas.
  - A systems thinking diagram to better visualize problem complexity.
  - We added a second weekly meeting to improve discussion and workflow.

### Did we need to remove extra steps?

- No extra steps were removed, but we adjusted the scope of our background review
  to focus on the most relevant sources.
