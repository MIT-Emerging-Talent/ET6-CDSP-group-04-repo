# Retrospective Milestone 2

## Progress and Process Improvement

This document summarizes the retrospective for Milestone 2. It highlights key learnings, challenges, and successes our
team experienced while advancing the project, incorporating a new team member, and refining our workflow and research focus.

Despite the busy period and evolving processes, our team remained committed and adaptable. This retrospective captures
what worked, what didn’t, and what we aim to improve moving forward.

---

## Stop Doing

- Expecting full engagement from all members during a busy season without considering realistic constraints.  
- Relying on asynchronous work without a clear structure and agreed-upon methods for tracking progress.  
- Insufficiently strict approach to documentation and centralized information storage, leading to loss of information.  
- Switching to a new platform (Slack → Git Discussions) without a clearly defined and tested process, causing confusion.

---

## Continue Doing

- Regularly providing follow-up updates after calls to keep the whole team informed of decisions and next steps.  
- Accompanying own actions with messages in team chats to maintain transparency and synchronization.  
- Being flexible in scheduling additional meetings as needed to address arising issues promptly (added +2 calls during
Milestone 2).  
- Maintaining a culture of mutual support where everyone is ready to back up teammates, help, and take on others’ tasks
if necessary.  

---

## Start Doing

- Introduce new project management and planning tools, such as MiroBoard, to improve task visualization and
retrospectives.  
- Organize and standardize the repository structure in advance to avoid confusion and ensure ease of teamwork.  
- Allocate time to prepare the workspace and agree on processes before starting next phases to minimize disruptions
caused by organizational changes.  

---

## Lessons Learned

- Deeply diving into sub-questions of the main research question helped clarify the right perspectives and goals, based
on available data.  
- The addition of a new experienced member brought fresh insights and valuable expertise, positively impacting the team.
- Asynchronous work remains a challenge requiring further tuning and improvement of communication processes.  

---

## Strategy vs. Execution

- All main points of the plan were generally accomplished, helping maintain project structure and progress.  
- However, minor inaccuracies in the initial task documentation led to questions about priorities — specifically which
aspects to focus on (data collection, data cleaning, etc.).  
- Data collection for the main research question is ongoing, as the process proved to be more extensive and dynamic than
initially expected.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Yevheniia Rudenko

**Contributions:**  

- Organized the project, facilitated calls, and managed asynchronous team work.  
- Researched resources and worked on her assigned sub-question.  
- Maintained follow-up update structures and stayed connected with the team to avoid communication gaps.  
- Worked on creating a more structured organization process.  

**Challenges:**  

- High workload and busy season made it difficult to maintain commitment and focus.  
- Sometimes got confused and struggled to concentrate on one specific area.  
- Limited available information on the topic, with some resources behind paywalls.  

**Progress:**  

- Improved skills in maintaining regular communication and follow-up structures.  
- Enhanced ability to organize workflow and stay connected with the team.  
- Explored websites and applications relevant to the research topic to compensate for limited information.  
- Recognized the need for kick-off meetings to better organize work in future milestones.

### Yuri Spizhovyi

**Contributions:**  

- Focused on collecting and organizing a structured dataset of IT training programs in the U.S.  
- Created a data cleaning notebook to normalize program cost, duration, and accessibility.  
- Added real-world references where available to improve the dataset's realism.  
- Documented the process in a clear format and supported integration with GitHub and Google Colab workflows.  

**Challenges:**  

- Cleaning required additional effort to standardize inconsistent fields like cost and length.  
- Encountered missing or vague entries (e.g., “Varies”, “Ongoing”) that needed estimation or handling.  
- Needed to balance speed and accuracy when deciding whether to use modeled vs. real data.  

**Progress:**  

- Improved skills in structuring data cleaning logic and documenting decisions clearly.  
- Gained confidence working with Git versioning and shared repository structure.  
- Developed templates and prompts that may be reused by teammates in similar tasks.

### Khadija Ramlawi

**Contributions:**  

- Researched for resources and worked on my assigned sub-question to gather datasets.  
- Shared leads and aligned data needs with teammates.  
- Facilitated meetings for the team to make sure we're always on the same page.  

**Challenges:**  

- Hard to find recent, refugee-specific data related to our question.  
- Had a problem with my laptop and therefore faced Git setup issues that delayed work.  
- Hard to manage work along with family commitments, especially with a few emergencies this week.  

**Progress:**  

- Built confidence using public data portals (IPUMS, MPI, ORR).  
- Improved data evaluation skills and identified new data leads.

### Olubusayo Solola

**Contributions:**  

- Shared relevant resources, including pushing some of the research
findings to GitHub for better accessibility and version tracking.
- Researched resources and worked on assigned sub-question.  

**Challenges:**  

- Faced unforeseen personal and academic challenges that affected
  consistency, leading to missed meetings and delays in reviewing
  key research papers.
- Found it difficult to concentrate on a single aspect of the project
  at times, due to overlapping responsibilities and shifting priorities

**Progress:**  

- Recognized the value of maintaining regular communication across
  a distributed team.
- Improved ability to adapt and contribute despite setbacks by using
  open-source platforms (like GitHub) and publicly available tools.
- Learned the importance of early-stage planning, such as kickoff
  meetings, to set clearer expectations and improve team alignment
  for future projects
