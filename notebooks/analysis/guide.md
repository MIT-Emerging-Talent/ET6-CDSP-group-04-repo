# Final Analysis: Guide

This folder is used for conducting final analysis and drawing conclusions from your datasets.

This may include:

- Statistical summaries
- Modeling (if applicable)
- Final visualizations or comparison tables

Notebooks here should lead directly into Milestone 4 deliverables or communication materials.
Keep your code clean, commented, and reproducible.
