# Cleaning Notebooks: Guide

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used during Milestone 2 for data cleaning and preparation.

Each team member should include:

- The name of the dataset they cleaned
- All steps from loading raw data to saving the cleaned output
- Comments and markdown explanations

Cleaned datasets should be saved to `data/cleaned/`.
