# Exploratory Analysis: Guide

This folder contains notebooks created during Milestone 3 for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Use this space to:

- Generate charts and plots
- Explore patterns and trends
- Form hypotheses or insights based on cleaned data

These notebooks are intended for internal learning and insight discovery. Final insights should be refined and moved
to the analysis stage.
