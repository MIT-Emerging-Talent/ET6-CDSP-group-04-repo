# 📄 INSTRUCTION

Hi everyone!  
Just a quick note on how to use this file while we work on it:

🗓 On **June 28**, we divided our main topic into sub-questions, and now each person is responsible for their assigned
 sub-question — at least for this initial stage. Later on, of course, we’ll all need to understand the full
picture and how everything connects.

The idea of this document is to track what we have, so we know what kind of insights we can draw later.

## 📌 Instructions

- If you’re working on a sub-question, please add any resources you find.
- This can be:
  - A link to a website
  - Or, if you’ve downloaded a dataset or article and uploaded it to GitHub, please write its name and reference it
  clearly here.
- **Important:** For every link or resource you add, please include a short description — what kind of information it
contains and why it might be useful.

## 🧩 Sections (for inspiration — optional)

- Key Questions  
- Example  
- Matrix  
- Suggested Data Sources  

Feel free to adjust or rewrite them if you think it helps your part.  
In the future, we’ll aim to organize everything in a unified format and style.
