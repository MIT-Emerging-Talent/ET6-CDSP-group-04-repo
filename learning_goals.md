 and analysis pipeline, ensuring smooth communication, task coordination,
 and conflict resolution.
2. **Version Control Mastery**:Use Git for tracking changes in data analysis
scripts, notebooks, and documentation handling branching,
merge conflicts, and collaboration workflows specific to data science.
3. **Code Review and Peer Feedback**
Regularly review each other's scripts, notebooks, and visualizations
for clarity, performance, and statistical soundness—fostering mutual
learning and high-quality outputs.
4. **Project Management with GitHub**
Utilize GitHub Issues, Projects, and Discussions to plan analyses,
assign tasks, track bugs, and manage timelines—ensuring transparency and
accountability.
